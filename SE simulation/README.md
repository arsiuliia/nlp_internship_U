As an intern, I had the opportunity to work on simulating a supermarket search engine for several reasons:

Data processing experience: Working with a large and extensive dataset allowed me to perform procedures such as filtering, sorting, and searching. This helped me enhance my data processing skills, which are valuable for roles in the retail industry.

Developing search algorithms that consider various query criteria specific to U and directly related to NLP to improve the search algorithm. For example, information extraction, pattern matching, and implementation of searchable attributes (existing in Salesforce) to enhance search results.

The goal of this task was to identify noise in the catalog and retrieve common phrases to enrich the dictionary, thereby optimizing the search engine.
